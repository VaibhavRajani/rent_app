This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Private Data Setup

This application uses private roommate data that is not tracked in Git for security reasons. To set up the private data:

1. Copy the template file:

   ```bash
   cp src/data/roommates.ts.template src/data/roommates.ts
   ```

2. Edit `src/data/roommates.ts` with your actual roommate information:

   - Replace `your-email@example.com` with the actual email
   - Update names, amounts, Venmo notes, and profile images
   - Set birthdays in `DD/MM` format (e.g., "29/11" for November 29th)

3. The private data includes sensitive information like birthdays (used as passwords) and emails, so it's excluded from version control.
